- Maintain consistent spacing
- Use grid systems for alignment
- Create style guides for projects

#### 4. Optimize for Performance
```
- Limit complex effects on many objects
- Use vectors when possible (SVG)
- Merge layers after finalizing
- Remove unnecessary anchor points
- Avoid excessive blurring/shadows
```

#### 5. Design for Different Use Cases
```
- Create vector versions (SVG) for scalability
- Export multiple resolutions
- Consider dark/light mode variants
- Plan for mobile/responsive use
- Test at actual size
```

### Common Use Cases

#### Logo Design
```
Prompt: "Create a modern tech startup logo"

### Best Practices

#### 1. Write Clear Comments

# Good: Clear, descriptive comments
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """Calculate the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers."""
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Bad: Unclear comments
def calc(n):
    # do stuff
    return sum(n) / len(n)
```

#### 2. Handle Edge Cases
```python
# Good: Handles edge cases
def safe_divide(a, b):
    """Safely divide two numbers."""
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

# Bad: No error handling
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b  # Fails on divide by zero
```

#### 3. Use Descriptive Names
```python
# Good: Clear variable names
user_email = "user@example.com"
account_balance = 1000.00

# Bad: Cryptic names
e = "user@example.com"
b = 1000.00
```

#### 4. Follow Language Conventions
- **Python**: Use snake_case, docstrings
- **JavaScript**: Use camelCase, const/let
- **Java**: Use camelCase, PascalCase for classes
- **C++**: Use snake_case, meaningful names

#### 5. Test with Multiple Inputs
```python
# Test various cases
test_cases = [0, 1, 100, -5, 1000, 999999]
for test in test_cases:
    result = your_function(test)
    print(f"Input: {test}, Output: {result}")
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Errors

**Syntax Errors:**

*Python:*
```python
# Missing colon
if x > 5
    print(x)

# Fix:
if x > 5:
    print(x)
```

*JavaScript:*
```javascript
// Missing semicolon (usually OK, but be consistent)
const x = 5

// Fix:
const x = 5;
```

*Java:*
```java
// Missing semicolon
System.out.println("Hello")

// Fix:
System.out.println("Hello");
```

*C++:*
```cpp
// Missing semicolon
cout << "Hello"

 // Fix:
cout << "Hello";
```

**Runtime Errors:**

*Division by Zero:*
```python
# Problem:
result = 10 / 0  # ZeroDivisionError

# Solution:
if b != 0:
    result = a / b
else:
    result = None
```

*Index Out of Bounds:*
```python
# Problem:
arr = [1, 2, 3]
print(arr[5])  # IndexError

# Solution:
if index < len(arr):
    print(arr[index])
else:
    print("Index out of range")
```

*Null/Undefined Values:*
```javascript
// Problem:
let user = null;
console.log(user.name);  // TypeError

// Solution:
if (user) {
    console.log(user.name);
} else {
    console.log("User not found");
}
```

#### Performance Issues

**Slow Execution:**
- Check for infinite loops
- Optimize algorithms (O(n²) → O(n log n))
- Reduce memory usage
- Use efficient data structures

**Memory Issues:**
- Avoid creating large arrays
- Don't store unnecessary data
- Use generators for large datasets
- Free up unused variables

**Timeout Issues:**
- Break large problems into smaller parts
- Use iterative instead of recursive when possible
- Optimize loops
- Reduce complexity

#### Language-Specific Issues

**Python:**
- Indentation errors (use 4 spaces)
- Import errors (check available packages)
- Type errors (use type hints)

**JavaScript:**
- Hoisting issues (declare before use)
- Async/await errors (handle promises)
- Scope issues (const/let vs var)

**Java:**
- Classpath issues
- Public class name must match filename
- Exception handling (checked vs unchecked)

**C++:**
- Header file includes
- Memory leaks (use smart pointers)
- Template errors

### Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific:**
   ```
   Vague: "Make a calculator"
   Specific: "Create a Python calculator class with add, subtract, multiply, divide methods"
   ```

2. **Provide Context:**
   ```
   "Write a function to sort a list of dictionaries by the 'name' key"
   "Create a class for a student with name, age, and grades"
   ```

3. **Ask for Help:**
   ```
   "Debug this code: [paste code]"
   "Explain what this algorithm does"
   "How can I optimize this?"
   ```

4. **Test Incrementally:**
   ```
   Step 1: Write basic function
   Step 2: Add error handling
   Step 3: Optimize performance
   Step 4: Add tests
   ```

5. **Request Explanations:**
   ```
   "Why did you choose this approach?"
   "Explain the time complexity"
   "What are the trade-offs?"
   ```

### Example Debugging Session

```
You: "This Python code is failing:
def find_max(numbers):
    max = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max:
            max = num
    return max

print(find_max([-5, -10, -2]))"

AI: "The issue is that you initialize `max` to 0. With all negative numbers, 0 is larger than any of them, so the function returns 0 instead of the actual maximum (-2).

Here's the fixed version:

def find_max(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Cannot find max of empty list")
    max_num = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num

print(find_max([-5, -10, -2]))  # Returns -2"
```
