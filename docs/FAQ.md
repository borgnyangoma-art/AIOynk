## Quick Tips

### Getting Better Results

**Be specific:** "Create a modern, minimalist logo in blue and white for a tech startup" works better than "make a logo"

**Provide examples:** "Like Apple's website but for a restaurant"

**Iterate:** "That's good, but make the background darker" is more helpful than "I don't like it"

**Use feedback:** The AI learns from your feedback, so be honest about what works and what doesn't

### Save Time

**Use templates:** Ask for "a template for a restaurant menu" instead of starting from scratch

**Ask for variations:** "Create 3 different versions" to get options

**Combine tools:** Create a logo, then use it in a website

**Reuse projects:** "Create a similar design but for a different business"

### Common Mistakes

❌ Being too vague
✅ Being specific with details

❌ Deleting without exporting
✅ Always export before deleting

❌ Not saving
✅ Save regularly

❌ Trying to do everything at once
✅ Break complex requests into smaller steps
